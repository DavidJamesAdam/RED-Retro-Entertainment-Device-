Welcome! This will be a quick tl;dr of this project; resources, list of components, process of creating RED, etc., will all be in separate .md files so they are easy to access and someone doesn't have to go through a single file to search for a specific piece of information.

RED was a project I started beginning of Decemeber 2023, and "finished" a week or two into January 2024. "Finished" is in quotes because I still intend on iterating on the case and making in less _Frankenstein-y_. 

The intention for RED was to build my own handheld gaming device that ran RetroPie so I could take it anywhere and play the retro games that I loved including a lot of the ones I may have missed out on. I wanted full control of every part of the design process, so minus the
OS and components, I designed everything myself (case, buttons, what components to include, etc.). I was heavily inspired by Leandro Linares handheld gaming project, the video of which you can find in the resources file. He had a very clean, very functional device that 
really leant itself to a solid gaming experience, I'd imagine.

Using the current iteration of RED still feels pretty decent. I'm lucky in that for the next iteration, there's very little I have to change/add. All I really need to do is add a second joystick, redesign the buttons so they don't stick as often, move the shoulder button
holes so they feel more comfortable and natural, and make the case a little bigger to accommodate wires and components (and tidy up the wires).
