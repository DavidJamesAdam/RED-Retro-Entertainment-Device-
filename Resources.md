- I ultimately only used GPIOnext for volume control as I couldn't figure out a way to get the analog joystick to work, but if your project has only push buttons, GPIOnext is super handy.

[Code I heavily based my code off of](https://github.com/gianodog/MCP3008-GPIO_joystick/blob/master/MCP3008-GPIO_joystick.py)
- Note: This code doesn't work, or at least I couldn't get it to work exactly as it is, but it includes a lot of stuff I used.

- Note: I mainly used the Adafruit website to get my sound working, but it's always nice to have more resources

Components:

Note: these can probably be bought (and variations can be found, depending on what you're looking for) probably mostly through Amazon.

I'm hoping that's everything. I may add to this as I think of other stuff I used.
